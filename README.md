This is the main API used to connect all of TheAura's "modules" (otherwise known as plugins) together. Usage of the API can be for anything, whether it be for your own server or to help add onto TheAura!

#### What is TheAura?
> TheAura is a server that is inspired by many other servers, namely [MCNext](https://www.reddit.com/r/MCNext/ "MCNext subreddit") and Daegonner. The first launch was on September 10, 2015 and the server closed down shortly due to personal issues. Overtime, TheAura's core has evolved from being simplistic and dependent on other plugins to being an entirely custom plugin with greatly increased functionality. TheAura is planned to be reopened the Summer of 2017.

#### What can I do with this?
..* Help TheAura by submitting your own modules with any feature you want!
..* Use the API for your own server's backend. TheAura's API is constantly changing and quite mature, so you don't have to worry about updating everything on your own!
..* Commit to this repository in order to increase functionality and stability of the API.
..* Just look at it to learn!
